# 🕶️ Spectacles Detection using VGG16 (Transfer Learning)

This project is a binary image classification model that detects whether a person in a given image is **wearing spectacles** or **not**. It uses **Transfer Learning with VGG16**, a powerful pretrained convolutional neural network from the ImageNet dataset.
